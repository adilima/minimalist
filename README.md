# minimalist
a minimal set of file needed to create android project

# purpose
I am tired having to create project in Android Studio, or any other Studios, including Eclipse, they're slow, and eating up my RAM and CPU,
and for just testing or exercise with android, these overgrown, gigantic studios are really unnecessary for me, in fact they're just standing my way.

Because I'll be using Android-x86 to compile and test, and thus learn more about android system, I firmly believe I am better off do most of the task manually.
